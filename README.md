# Stock Fetcher Test
In this project, I am doing just a test between Java and Python api call.
    There is a simple API which the client or request has to call and the return type 
    is JSON data of stocks, now what i have done is that, write the data to a file line by line.

    And then we will just see the time taken and compare.

## First Test: (Java without Parallel Stream):
*Java*:

*Python*:
